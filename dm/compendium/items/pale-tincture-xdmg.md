# Pale Tincture
*Adventuring gear, poison (ingested)*  


- **Properties**: [Poison](/3-Mechanics/CLI/item-properties.md#Poison)
- **Cost**: 250 gp

A creature subjected to Pale Tincture must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(3)` (`d6`) Poison damage and have the [Poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition. The [Poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Poisoned) creature repeats the save every 24 hours, taking `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(3)` (`d6`) Poison damage on a failed save. The damage the poison deals can't be healed by any means while the creature remains [Poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Poisoned). After seven successful saves against the poison, the creature is no longer [Poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Poisoned).
