# Ring of Invisibility
*Ring, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](items/XDMG/Ring of Invisibility.webp#right)


While wearing this ring, you can take a [Magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Magic) action to give yourself the [Invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Invisible) condition. You remain [Invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Invisible) until the ring is removed or until you take a [Bonus Action](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) to become visible again.
