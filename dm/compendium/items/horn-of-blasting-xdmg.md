# Horn of Blasting
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](items/XDMG/Horn of Blasting.webp#right)


You can take a [Magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Magic) action to blow the horn, which emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot [Cone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cone-area-of-effect-xphb.md) that is audible out to 600 feet. Each creature in the [Cone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cone-area-of-effect-xphb.md) makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:5d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`5d8`) Thunder damage and has the [Deafened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Deafened) condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. Glass or crystal objects in the [Cone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cone-area-of-effect-xphb.md) that aren't being worn or carried take `dice:10d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`10d8`) Thunder damage.

Each use of the horn's magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals `dice:10d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`10d6`) Force damage to the user and destroys the horn.
