# Keoghtom's Ointment
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](items/XDMG/Keoghtoms Ointment.webp#right)


This glass jar, 3 inches in diameter, contains `dice:1d4+1|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d4 + 1`) doses of a thick mixture that smells faintly of aloe. The jar and its contents weigh 1/2 pound.

As a [Utilize](/3-Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Utilize) action, you can swallow one dose of the ointment or apply it to a creature within 5 feet of yourself. The creature that receives it regains `dice:2d8+2|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8 + 2`) [Hit Points](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) and ceases to have the [Poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition.
