# Ring of Regeneration
*Ring, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](items/XDMG/Ring of Regeneration.webp#right)


While wearing this ring, you regain `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) [Hit Points](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) every 10 minutes if you have at least 1 [Hit Point](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md). If you lose a body part, the ring causes the missing part to regrow and return to full functionality after `dice:1d6+1|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) days if you have at least 1 [Hit Point](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) the whole time.
