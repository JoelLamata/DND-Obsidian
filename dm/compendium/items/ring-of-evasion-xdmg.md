# Ring of Evasion
*Ring, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](items/XDMG/Ring of Evasion.webp#right)


This ring has 3 charges, and it regains `dice:1d3|noform|noparens|avg` (`d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. When you fail a Dexterity saving throw while wearing the ring, you can take a [Reaction](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) to expend 1 charge to succeed on that save instead.
