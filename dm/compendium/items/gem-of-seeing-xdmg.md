# Gem of Seeing
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](items/XDMG/Gem of Seeing.webp#right)


This gem has 3 charges. As a [Magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Magic) action, you can expend 1 charge. For the next 10 minutes, you have [Truesight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/senses.md#Truesight) out to 120 feet when you peer through the gem.

The gem regains `dice:1d3|noform|noparens|avg` (`d3`) expended charges daily at dawn.
