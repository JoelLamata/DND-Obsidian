![](items/HAT-LMI/Red Wizard Blade.webp#right)

Forged by Red Wizards using a secret process known only to them, this grim steel dagger draws its power from the Negative Plane. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using this magic dagger, the target takes an extra `dice:3d12|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d12`) necrotic damage.

A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this weapon dies and can't be raised from the dead except by a deity or by a creature using a [tablet of reawakening](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/tablet-of-reawakening-hat-lmi.md) to cast the [true resurrection](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/true-resurrection-xphb.md) spell.
