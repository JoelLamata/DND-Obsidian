# Lantern of Revealing
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](items/XDMG/Lantern of Revealing.webp#right)


While lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil, shedding [Bright Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md) in a 30-foot radius and [Dim Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) for an additional 30 feet. [Invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Invisible) creatures and objects are visible as long as they are in the lantern's [Bright Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md). You can take a [Utilize](/3-Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Utilize) action to lower the hood, reducing the lantern's light to [Dim Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) in a 5-foot radius.
