# Tablet of Reawakening
*Wondrous item, legendary*  
![](items/HAT-LMI/Tablet of Reawakening.webp#right)


Witches of Rashemen created this Tiny stone tablet to counter the necromancy of the Red Wizards. As an action, you can cast [true resurrection](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/true-resurrection-xphb.md) from the tablet. Once used in this way, the tablet turns to dust and is destroyed.
