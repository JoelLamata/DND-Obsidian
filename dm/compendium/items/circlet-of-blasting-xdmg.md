# Circlet of Blasting
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](items/XDMG/Circlet of Blasting.webp#right)


While wearing this circlet, you can cast [Scorching Ray](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/scorching-ray-xphb.md) with it (`dice:1d20+5|noform|noparens|text(+5)` to hit). The circlet can't cast this spell again until the next dawn.
