# Wand of Magic Missiles
*Wand, uncommon*  
![](items/XDMG/Wand of Magic Missiles.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can expend no more than 3 charges to cast [Magic Missile](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/magic-missile-xphb.md) from it. For 1 charge, you cast the level 1 version of the spell. You can increase the spell's level by 1 for each additional charge you expend.

## Regaining Charges

The wand regains `dice:1d6+1|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll `dice:1d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
