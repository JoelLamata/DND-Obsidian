# Boots of Elvenkind
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](items/XDMG/Boots of Elvenkind.webp#right)


While you wear these boots, your steps make no sound, regardless of the surface you are moving across. You also have [Advantage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Stealth)) checks.
