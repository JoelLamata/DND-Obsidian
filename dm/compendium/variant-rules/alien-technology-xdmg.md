# Alien Technology
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 73* 

When adventurers find a piece of technology that isn't from their world or time period, they can deduce what it is with a successful Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Investigation)) check, with the DC depending on the complexity of the item: DC 10 for a relatively simple item like a calculator or a lighter, or DC 20 for a complex item such as a computer, a chainsaw, or a hovercraft. You may require a separate Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Investigation)) check to determine whether a character can activate or operate the technology; a character who has observed the item in use or has operated a similar item either has [Advantage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on the check or succeeds on the check automatically (your choice).
