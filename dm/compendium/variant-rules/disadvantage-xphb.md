# Disadvantage
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 366. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

If you have Disadvantage on a [D20 Test](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/d20-test-xphb.md), roll two d20s and use the lower roll. A roll can't be affected by more than one Disadvantage, and [Advantage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) and Disadvantage on the same roll cancel each other.
