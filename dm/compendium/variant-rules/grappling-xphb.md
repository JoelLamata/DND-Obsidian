# Grappling
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 367. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

A creature can grapple another creature. Characters typically grapple by using an [Unarmed Strike](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/unarmed-strike-xphb.md). Many [monsters](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/monster-xphb.md) have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple prey. However a grapple is initiated, it follows these rules.

## Grappled Condition

Successfully grappling a creature gives it the [Grappled](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Grappled) condition.

## One Grapple per Hand

A creature must have a hand free to grapple another creature. Some stat blocks and game effects allow a creature to grapple using a tentacle, a maw, or another body part. Whatever part a grappler uses, it can grapple only one creature at a time with that part, and the grappler can't use that part to target another creature unless it ends the grapple.

## Ending a Grapple

A Grappled creature can use its action to make a Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Athletics)) or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check against the grapple's escape DC, ending the [condition](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/condition-xphb.md) on itself on a success. The [condition](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/condition-xphb.md) also ends if the grappler has the [Incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition or if the distance between the Grappled target and the grappler exceeds the grapple's range. In addition, the grappler can release the target at any time (no action required).
