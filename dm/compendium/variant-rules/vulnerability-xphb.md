# Vulnerability
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 377. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

If you have Vulnerability to a [damage type](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/damage-types-xphb.md), damage of that type is doubled against you. Vulnerability is applied only once to an instance of damage.
