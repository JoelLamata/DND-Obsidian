# Explosives
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 72* 

The Explosives table has examples of explosives. If no cost is given for an explosive, it can't typically be bought. If you make these explosives available for purchase, treat them as Rare magic items. Rules for explosives are given below.

![Explosives](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/explosives-xdmg.md)

## Bomb

As an action, you can light a Bomb and throw it at a point up to 60 feet away, where it explodes. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius [Sphere](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on that point makes a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:3d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d6`) Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Dynamite Stick

An an action, you can light a Dynamite Stick and throw it at a point up to 60 feet away, where it explodes. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius [Sphere](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on that point makes a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:3d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d6`) Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

It takes 1 minute to bind two or more Dynamite Sticks together so they explode at the same time. Each stick after the first increases the damage by `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) (to a maximum of `dice:10d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`10d6`)) and the effect's radius by 5 feet (to a maximum of 20 feet).

It takes 1 minute to rig dynamite with a longer fuse so it explodes after a longer period of time, such as 1 minute or 10 minutes.

## Grenades and Grenade Launchers

As an action, you can either throw a grenade at a point up to 60 feet away or use a Grenade Launcher to propel the grenade to a point up to 1,000 feet away. The grenade explodes at that point, creating a particular effect in a 20-foot-radius [Sphere](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md).

## Fragmentation Grenade

Each creature in the [Sphere](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:5d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(17)` (`5d6`) Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Smoke Grenade

The area of the [Sphere](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) is [Heavily Obscured](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/heavily-obscured-xphb.md) by smoke for 1 minute. A strong wind (such as the [Gust of Wind](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/gust-of-wind-xphb.md) spell) disperses the smoke.

## Gunpowder

Setting fire to a container full of Gunpowder causes it to explode. When a container explodes, each creature in a 10-foot-radius [Sphere](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on the container makes a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:3d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(10)` (`3d6`) Fire damage (for a powder horn) or `dice:7d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(24)` (`7d6`) Fire damage (for a keg) on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
