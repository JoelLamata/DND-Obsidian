*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 370. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

When you jump, you make either a [Long Jump](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/long-jump-xphb.md) (horizontal) or a [High Jump](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/high-jump-xphb.md) (vertical).
