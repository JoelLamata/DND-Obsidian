# Flying
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 367. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

A variety of effects allow a creature to fly. While flying, you fall if you have the [Incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Incapacitated) or [Prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Prone) condition or your [Fly Speed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/fly-speed-xphb.md) is reduced to 0. You can stay aloft in those circumstances if you can hover.
