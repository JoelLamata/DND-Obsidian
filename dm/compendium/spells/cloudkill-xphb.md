# Cloudkill
*5th-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a 20-foot-radius [Sphere](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) of yellow-green fog centered on a point within range. The fog lasts for the duration or until strong wind (such as the one created by [Gust of Wind](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/gust-of-wind-xphb.md)) disperses it, ending the spell. Its area is [Heavily Obscured](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/heavily-obscured-xphb.md).

Each creature in the [Sphere](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) makes a Constitution saving throw, taking `dice:5d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`5d8`) Poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this save when the [Sphere](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) moves into its space and when it enters the [Sphere](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

The [Sphere](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg|text(d8)` for each spell slot level above 5.
