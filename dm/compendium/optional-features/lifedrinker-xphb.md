**Prerequisite**: Level 9

Once per turn when you hit a creature with your pact weapon, you can deal an extra `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage (your choice) to the creature, and you can expend one of your [Hit Point Dice](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-point-dice-xphb.md) to roll it and regain a number of [Hit Points](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) equal to the roll plus your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 [Hit Point](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md)).
