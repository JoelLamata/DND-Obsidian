# Boon of Fate
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 210. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)*  

**Prerequisite**: 19th

You gain the following benefits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Increase one ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 30.

**Improve Fate.** When you or another creature within 60 feet of you succeeds on or fails a [D20 Test](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/d20-test-xphb.md), you can roll `dice:2d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d4`) and apply the total rolled as a bonus or penalty to the `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`) roll. Once you use this benefit, you can't use it again until you roll Initiative or finish a Short or Long Rest.
