## Traits

***Magic Resistance.*** The death knight has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Marshal Undead.*** Unless the death knight is [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated), it and undead creatures of its choice within 60 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against features that turn undead.

***Spellcasting.*** The death knight is a 19th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18, `dice: d20+10` (+10 to hit) with spell attacks). It has the following paladin spells prepared:

**1st level (4 slots)**: [command](compendium/spells/command.md), [compelled duel](compendium/spells/compelled-duel.md), [searing smite](compendium/spells/searing-smite.md)

**2nd level (3 slots)**: [hold person](compendium/spells/hold-person.md), [magic weapon](compendium/spells/magic-weapon.md)

**3rd level (3 slots)**: [dispel magic](compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md), [elemental weapon](compendium/spells/elemental-weapon.md)

**4th level (3 slots)**: [banishment](compendium/spells/banishment.md), [staggering smite](compendium/spells/staggering-smite.md)

**5th level (2 slots)**: [destructive wave](compendium/spells/destructive-wave.md) (necrotic)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The death knight makes three longsword attacks.

***Longsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+11` (+11 to hit), reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice: 1d8 + 5|avg` (`1d8 + 5`) slashing damage, or `dice: 1d10 + 5|avg` (`1d10 + 5`) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus `dice: 4d8|avg` (`4d8`) necrotic damage.

***Hellfire Orb (1/Day).*** The death knight hurls a magical ball of fire that explodes at a point it can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes `dice: 10d6|avg` (`10d6`) fire damage and `dice: 10d6|avg` (`10d6`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Reactions

***Parry.*** The death knight adds 6 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the death knight must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
