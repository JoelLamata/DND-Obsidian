# [Shrieker Fungus](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\plant/shrieker-fungus-xmm.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 125. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)*  

If exposed to light or otherwise disturbed, mushroom-like shriekers emit a high-pitched noise that gives them their name. This wailing might alert other creatures or attract predators.

## Fungi

*Deadly Spores and Predatory Polyps*

- **Habitat.** Underdark  
- **Treasure.** None  

The dank, sunless Underdark is a fertile breeding ground for weird and dangerous fungi.
